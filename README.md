# Variable Reduction by Correlation in Python
Describing a few quick and easy ways to reduce features to save time and computational resources. This could be followed up with more advanced techniques like PCA and variable clustering to get the final set of dimensions that is needed. 

Please go through the jupyter notebook and do let me know if there is any feedback on inconsistencies or improvements. Thanks!
